# EAFIT Challenge — Example Agent

An example AI agent with GitHub MCP integration, deployed as a Verifiable Service on the [Verana](https://verana.io) ecosystem. This is part of the [EAFIT Challenge](https://github.com/verana-labs/eafit-challenge).

## Architecture

This example agent is built with the [hologram-generic-ai-agent-vs](https://github.com/2060-io/hologram-generic-ai-agent-vs) container, which provides a ready-to-use AI chatbot with DIDComm messaging, verifiable credential authentication, and MCP tool integration.

You can find other agent examples (GitHub Agent, Wise Agent, etc.) in the [hologram-verifiable-services](https://github.com/2060-io/hologram-verifiable-services) repository.

This agent is a **child service** of the EAFIT Challenge organization. It:

1. Receives a **Service credential** from the organization (proves it's a legitimate service)
2. Uses the **Avatar credential definition** from `avatar.eafit.testnet.verana.network` to authenticate users via AnonCreds proof requests
3. Provides GitHub MCP tools to authenticated users via encrypted DIDComm chat

```

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (authenticated)
- `curl`, `jq`
- An OpenAI API key

The setup script connects to the deployed EAFIT organization at `admin.organization.eafit.testnet.verana.network` to obtain the Service credential. No local organization instance is required.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up the VS Agent (deploys container, gets Service credential)
source config.env
./scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Start the full stack (chatbot + redis + postgres)
export NGROK_DOMAIN=<your-ngrok-domain>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
./scripts/start.sh
```

> Note: if you don't want to use an OPENAI_API_KEY, you can configure any other LLM, refer to [agent pack schema](https://github.com/2060-io/hologram-generic-ai-agent-vs/blob/main/docs/agent-pack-schema.md) for available options.

## Kubernetes Deployment (GitHub Actions)

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow deploys the agent to the shared EAFIT Challenge K8s cluster.

### Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `OVH_KUBECONFIG` | Kubeconfig for the K8s cluster |
| `K8S_NAMESPACE` | Target namespace (ideally, use your team name) |
| `EXAMPLE_AGENT_OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for the chatbot |
| `EXAMPLE_AGENT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password |
| `EXAMPLE_AGENT_MCP_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encryption key for MCP user configs (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `EXAMPLE_AGENT_WALLET_KEY` | VS Agent wallet encryption key (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`) |
| `EXAMPLE_AGENT_VSAGENT_DB_PASSWORD` | VS Agent internal DB password |

### Deployment

Run the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab with step `all` to deploy and obtain credentials.

The agent will be available at the URL configured in `AGENT_PUBLIC_URL` (see below).

## Configuration

Key settings in `config.env`:

- **`AGENT_PUBLIC_URL`** — Public URL of the deployed agent. For student teams, use the convention: `https://<agentname>.agents.<team_name>.teams.eafit.testnet.verana.network`
- **`CREDENTIAL_DEFINITION_ID`** — AnonCreds credDef from the EAFIT Avatar service (hardcoded)
- **`ORG_VS_PUBLIC_URL`** — Public URL of the EAFIT organization agent
- **`SERVICE_NAME`** — Display name shown in the Service credential
- **`OPENAI_MODEL`** — LLM model for the chatbot
